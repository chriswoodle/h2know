We wanted to find ways in conserving water. Through quick searches, we found most water consumption in the US comes from the agriculture industry.

To get some guidance, we roamed through the EarthX conference. We spoke with non-profit organizations, private companies, farmers, and municipal organizations. After meeting and getting informed perspective, we shifted from industrial to consumer residential as our target market. The average Texas resident uses a little above 200 gallons of water per day. Water irrigation systems and sprinkler systems can use up to 1,860 gallons a day.
What it does

Our user, essentially a homeowner, can view their water usage in gallons over the course of week, months, year, and even live data.

To install, user needs a smart hub and sensors for water exit points. The Smart Hub relays data between server and sensor. Sensors are placed in areas like kitchen sink, sprinkler system, bathroom sinks, laundry washer, and toilets, for example.
